                oh yah i also went to the miku concert this past weekend yayyyy yayyyyy. I need to think harder about what i put in these blogs. or maybe i need to think less. i have an intense fear of posting on the internet which is why 90% of my social medias are blank except instagram which i think about for 3 hours before posting. maybe one day ill get better at posting but for now these words are on the internet for as long as i keep paying for this domain

I am not sad but I know my summer will be a continous straining towards the next big thing, a drive to keep going "because x is coming up" or "because its just next week". Not a bad mindset, but it doesn't make the days easier. For now I will keep working, because I don't hate my work, I walk around, I listen to my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_(podcast)">podcast</a> (very good so far) and I come home.<br>

                I also got a huge scholarship for my college, it might all be paid for. Lots of really nice things going on at the moment, and I am very very tired. <br> <br>
                I got my PS5 streaming to my mac specifically so I could put more hours into Hollow Knight. I currently have 19 hours in Hollow Knight. I started 3 days ago. Good game!! <br>
                Tomorrow if I have free time I might work on this site more, it makes me happy but I put too much pressure on myself quickly and got burned out, hyperfixation over as quickly as it started, hate it, but I love the freedom the dumb 90s style gives me. <br>
                Might eventually have parts of the site in a much more modern style, but I'll probably forever keep this overall aesthetic, its my favorite. <br> <br>

                Anotheer much cooler thing in a similar vibe is <a href="https://search.marginalia.nu/">Marginalia</a>, an independent search engine that prefers to show you websites you've probably never heard of in your searches. Use it a bit!! <br> <br>

                hi<br>
                I am in college now. It's horrific. It's so COOL!!  I am learning nothing significant in any of my classes. <br>
                I am making some of the most wonderful friends I've ever made in my LIFE !! I am living with my boyfriend who I LOVE !! <br>
                I had the best Halloween of my LIFE !! I have been so happy in nearly every aspect, and every time I am not I find a way to be happy. It will be okay. <br>

                Every other project in my life has taken precedent over this website however I love it so MUCH and want to improve it, especially it's shitty HTML interior. I'd love to use 11ty or something similar to hack it together soon. <br>
                Maybe a Christmas break project. <br>
                I think right now I'll add more links under the fun n cool links section, to show my friends fun things :D. In the time since the last post I've fully set up and not played on a modded minecraft server which is fun. <br>
                I need to do my calculus work right now. It's kicking my ASS !! I keep bullshitting my way through the tests. I need to be like this. <br>

                I applied for SNAP benefits today, so maybe I'll get more money. Might lose my VA benefits with the election. And my rights. Might get MORE money, stocks have been surging! Wahoo !!! AHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAH. <br>

                have a time to POST! But here I am watching coverage of the Atlantic Signal leak after class and typing ! <br>
                I have had a wonderful wonderful wonderful time in college oh my gosh. I love my boyfriend more than the world and so does my FAMILY! Yay <br>
                I dyed my hair like a DEER I bought more deer PLUSHIES I put deer on my CAR! <br>
                Look at my hair ( ˶ˆᗜˆ˵ ) <br>
                <img src="/media/deer-hair.jpg" alt="my deer hair" class="blog-image"> <br>
                I keep wanting to do more to this website, but all I do is rewrite my CSS over and over and over to make it nicer looking. I need CONTENT! <br>
                I want to add spotify control buttons, and more fun links, and a way to interact more! It'll make me happy AND force me to learn more about actual coding. <br>
                Everyday I try and hide my digital footprint and every day I post more and more personal info on this website. <br>
                Current life events involve needing to appeal an insurance claim, looking for decorations for an apartment, and planning meals daily. Why do they make you do these things. <br>
                Despite the sorrow I am enjoying life so much overall and I'm so excited to keep being in college doing college things. I get to get high and watch my favorite shows with my favorite person I can stay here forever. <br>

                Updating from last post, I don't get SNAP unless I have a job, my VA benefits actually INCREASED with the nazis in office, and stocks fell IMMENSELY !! I lost 1000s ! :3 <br>
                Fun link today is <a href="https://classic.minecraft.net/?join=Qf5PoAymXYy2cdHE"> Minecraft Classic</a> entirely in a browser. Fun multiplayer when you're bored as HELL !
